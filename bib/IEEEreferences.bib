abstract = {This paper focuses on human activity recognition (HAR) problem, in which inputs are multichannel time series signals acquired from a set of bodyworn inertial sensors and outputs are predefined human activities. In this problem, extracting effective features for identifying activities is a critical but challenging task. Most existing work relies on heuristic hand-crafted feature design and shallow feature learning architectures, which cannot find those distinguishing features to accurately classify different activities. In this paper, we propose a systematic feature learning method for HAR problem. This method adopts a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate feature learning from the raw inputs in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are deemed as the higher level abstract representation of low level raw time series signals. By leveraging the labelled information via supervised learning, the learned features are endowed with more discriminative power. Unified in one model, feature learning and classification are mutually enhanced. All these unique advantages of the CNN make it outperform other HAR algorithms, as verified in the experiments on the Opportunity Activity Recognition Challenge and other benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {This paper describes how to recognize certain types of human physical activities using acceleration data generated by a user's cell phone. We propose a recognition system in which a new digital low-pass filter is designed in order to isolate the component of gravity acceleration from that of body acceleration in the raw data. The system was trained and tested in an experiment with multiple human subjects in real-world conditions. Several classifiers were tested using various statistical features. High-frequency and low-frequency components of the data were taken into account. We selected five classifiers each offering good performance for recognizing our set of activities and investigated how to combine them into an optimal set of classifiers. We found that using the average of probabilities as the fusion method could reach an overall accuracy rate of 91.15%.}

abstract="Activity-Based Computing [1] aims to capture the state of the user and its environment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors in order to provide adaptation to exogenous computing resources. When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI.",

abstract={Recently, a considerable amount of research has focused on understanding transportation mobility patterns from crowdsourced smartphone data. To this end, transportation mode detection is an indispensable, yet challenging task towards deriving meaningful information from large datasets collected using smartphones. Most studies to date use Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) derived data such as speed to detect transportation mode. Limited research relies on sensors that do not depend on external sources, such as accelerometer and gyroscope. The present work proposes a methodological framework based on machine learning for identifying the transportation mode using accelerometer, gyroscope and orientation data in the absence of battery consuming sensors, such as GNSS. Different models are developed and compared based on random forest and gradient boosting machine algorithms. A comparative study between GNSS free and GNSS based algorithms is also established. Results are further discussed and possible research directions are provided.},
